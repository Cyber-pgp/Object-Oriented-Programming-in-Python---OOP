# Imagine you have a toy box full of different kinds of toys. Each kind of toy can do different things. # For example, a car toy can roll, a doll can sing a song, and a robot toy might light up and move.

# In Python, OOP (which stands for Object-Oriented Programming) is like having a toy box. In this toy box, instead of toys, we have "objects." Each object is like a different kind of toy:

# Classes: 
# Think of a class as the blueprint or recipe to make a specific kind of toy. It tells Python how to make an object. So, if you have a blueprint for a car, you can make many car objects, each with its own color and brand.

# Objects: 
# These are like the toys you play with. Each one can do specific things and has its own features. For example, a car object can have a color, a brand, and the ability to drive forward or backward.


# Methods: 
# These are like the actions you can make your toys do. If your car toy can roll, "roll" is like a method. In Python, methods are the actions that objects can do.

# Attributes: 
# These are like the features or things your toy comes with. If your car toy is red and has four wheels, "red" and "four wheels" are its attributes. In Python, objects have attributes that tell us about them, like color or size.

# So, OOP in Python is a way of programming by making blueprints (classes) to create objects, which can do actions (methods) and have features (attributes), just like how you play with different kinds of toys and make them do fun things!
